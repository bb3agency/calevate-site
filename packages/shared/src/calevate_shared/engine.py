    WHY THIS EXISTS. "Switching engines is a config change" was true of the METHODS —
    every adapter implements the same Protocol — and false of the ANSWERS. Bolna is BYOK
    on all three speech legs, owns campaign objects and a built-in knowledge base, signs
    nothing, and fronts Indian telephony. An engine that dictates its own TTS, has no
    knowledge base and signs its webhooks implements exactly the same Protocol and
    disagrees with almost every one of those. Until this type existed those differences
    were expressed as `raise` inside individual adapter methods — discoverable only by
    calling and failing, which means a screen could offer a control the engine will
    refuse, and did.

    So each adapter DECLARES, and every site that used to hard-code Bolna's answer asks
    instead. Two rules make the declaration worth trusting:

    * **An absent capability produces a named refusal, not a crash and not a silent
      no-op.** `apps/api/engine/capabilities.py` holds the one selector and the one
      refusal, in the shape `payment_capability`/`lead_retrieval_capability`/
      `get_sheets_transport` already established.
    * **A claimed capability is exercised by the conformance suite.** A descriptor an
      adapter can lie in is worse than none, because it turns a runtime failure into a
      confident wrong answer — the same defect `CostBreakdown.currency_stated` and
      `AgentSnapshot.*_readable` were introduced to kill.

    NO DEFAULTS, deliberately. Every field is required, so a new adapter must answer
    every question in writing rather than inherit today's engine's answers by omission —
    which is exactly how a Bolna-shaped assumption got everywhere in the first place.
    Frozen because a capability that can be mutated at runtime is a capability two
    callers can disagree about.

#: a dead LLM. Neither site was wrong when it was written; there was simply nowhere for

#:
#: It is also what TRD §10 has always PRICED — the ₹0.00 LLM leg is "Sarvam 105B, free per

    TWO `_readable` FLAGS, FOR THE `CostBreakdown.currency_stated` REASON. A missing
    field and an empty value are different facts, and the difference is the whole answer
    here: an adapter that could not FIND the prompt in the response must not report the
