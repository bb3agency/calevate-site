# Get Recording By Signed Link

> The signed link a call report hands out as `recording.url`, for a CRM user to click: it needs **no API key**, because the signature is the permission. Use the URL exactly as the report gives it; add `&download=1` to save rather than play. The link stops working at its `expiresAt`, which is when your plan deletes the recording. A forged link and an unknown call get the same `404`. Answers are plain text, not JSON.

tags:
  - name: Agents
    description: >-
      An agent is one assistant with its instructions, model, languages, website
      widget and call settings — the same thing the console's Agent page builds.
      Create one here, then give it knowledge, actions and channels.
  - name: Knowledge
    description: >-
      The documents an agent searches and cites when it answers — a web page or
      pasted text, split into passages and indexed. Use it for facts (prices,
      policies, opening hours) rather than putting them in the instructions.
  - name: Actions
    description: >-
      Calls to your own HTTPS API that an agent can make mid-conversation, with
      arguments it fills from what the customer said — how an agent uses data
      that stays in your own system. Create one, test it, then switch it on.
  - name: Tools
    description: >-
      Everything else an agent can do besides answer: its built-in tools, the
      MCP tool servers it is connected to, and the accounts it works in
      (calendar, spreadsheets, CRMs, records kept here, helpdesks). Every tool
      starts off.
  - name: Channels
    description: >-
      Where an agent answers: the website widget, WhatsApp, Telegram and calls.
      Read an agent's channels here and connect a Telegram bot; WhatsApp is
      connected in the console, because Meta's sign-up runs in the business
      owner's own browser.
  - name: Calls
    description: >-
      A call is one phone, web or WhatsApp conversation with an agent — one you
      placed through the API, a campaign's, or one a customer made to you. Place
      calls here, one at a time or in a batch, and read each one back with its
      summary, collected details and transcript.
  - name: Post-call
    description: >-
      What happens after a call ends: the outcome, a short summary and the
      details the agent collects. Read a call's analysis here, and set what an
      agent does after every call.
  - name: Recordings
    description: >-
      A call's audio, for agents that record their calls. Fetch it with your
      key, or hand a CRM user the signed link a call report carries — that one
      needs no key.
  - name: Conversations
    description: >-
      A conversation is one customer's thread with your workspace on one channel
      — WhatsApp, the web widget, Telegram, voice or email. Read threads and
      their messages (including to catch up on a webhook you missed), answer a
      WhatsApp customer from your own agent platform, and resolve, take over or
      assign threads as the inbox does.
  - name: Messages
    description: >-
      Send one approved WhatsApp template to one customer, because something
      happened in your own system — an order confirmation, a delivery update, an
      appointment reminder. No agent is needed: this is how your software starts
      a WhatsApp conversation.
  - name: One-time codes
    description: >-
      Deliver a login or verification code you generated over WhatsApp, without
      handling templates yourself, and set up the authentication templates it
      sends with. WhatsApp writes these messages — "*394812* is your
      verification code." — so you choose only the expiry, the security line and
      the button.
  - name: Contacts
    description: >-
      The people your workspace knows — kept in step with your CRM by phone
      number and your own `externalId`, with marketing consent recorded
      alongside where it came from.
  - name: Do not call
    description: >-
      Numbers your agents must never ring. Every outbound call refuses a number
      on this list — Create Call answers `409`, a batch refuses that entry, a
      calling campaign skips the person and records why, and a booked callback
      is given up — while inbound calls from it are answered as usual. The same
      list as **Contacts → Do not contact** in the console, and the one your
      voice agent adds to on its own when a caller asks not to be called again
      (in any language), which also sends the `contact.opted_out` webhook event.
  - name: Events
    description: >-
      Tell us something happened in your system — `order.delivered`,
      `trial.ended` — and the sequences and tags you set up in the console
      decide what follows. Your code says what happened; the console says what
      happens next.
  - name: Templates
    description: >-
      WhatsApp message templates: the pre-approved messages your business may
      send to a customer first, or outside the 24 hours after they last wrote. A
      template is saved as a draft, sent to WhatsApp for review, and can be sent
      (Send Message, Create Campaign) only once it is `approved`. Templates are
      named, not numbered, and one name can exist in several languages.
  - name: Campaigns
    description: >-
      A campaign sends one thing to many people. It is either a WhatsApp
      **broadcast** (`kind: "whatsapp"`), which sends one approved template to
      everyone in its audience, or a **calling campaign** (`kind: "voice"`),
      where an agent phones each person from its own number within the hours you
      set. Who is in the audience is decided by consent, exactly as in the
      console, and every campaign is created as a draft that you then launch,
      schedule, pause, resume or cancel.
  - name: Sequences
    description: >-
      A sequence sends one person several approved WhatsApp templates over days
      — "your order shipped", then "how was it?" two days later — and stops by
      itself when they reply, are tagged, or an event says so. People join by
      tag, by event, or one at a time through Enrol in Sequence. Sequence ids
      are bare uuids.
  - name: Forms
    description: >-
      A WhatsApp form is a screen your customer fills in without leaving the
      chat — a delivery address, an appointment request, a short survey. Build
      it here, publish it to your own WhatsApp Business Account, then send it
      from a template's button, an agent, the inbox or Reply to Conversation.
  - name: Phone numbers
    description: >-
      The numbers your agents answer and call from. A workspace holds them two
      ways: numbers it **rents** here, charged every month from your balance,
      and numbers it **brings** from its own carrier account, which we never
      bill. Each number is answered by at most one agent (its line) and may be
      lent to one agent to call out on. A number is named by the number itself,
      in any spelling: `918041234567`, `+918041234567` and `%2B918041234567` in
      a path are the same number.
  - name: SMS
    description: >-
      Your own SMS provider and your own DLT registration, so your agents can
      text customers in India — during a call (the `send_sms` built-in tool) and
      after it (an agent's post-call `followUp`). Every business SMS in India
      must match a template approved on your DLT portal and go out under your
      six-letter sender header; your provider bills you for each one, and
      nothing is charged to your wallet here. Providers: `msg91`, `exotel`,
      `gupshup` (Enterprise SMS), `infobip`, `vonage`, `fast2sms`. On your DLT
      portal, add your provider as your telemarketer (the PE–TM chain) or every
      send is rejected.
  - name: Voices
    description: >-
      The voices an agent can speak with, as the console's voice picker lists
      them. An item's `id` is what an agent's `voice.voice` takes.
  - name: Voice clones
    description: >-
      Your workspace's own cloned voices, made from a short recording with the
      speaker's consent. A clone is listed with the Studio voices and can be put
      on an agent like any other voice.
  - name: Models
    description: >-
      The language models an agent can answer with, as the console names them.
      An item's `id` is what an agent's `model` takes.
  - name: Bring your own keys
    description: >-
      Run your agents on your own provider accounts and pay a flat platform fee
      instead of our usage rates. Bring all three keys (speech-to-text, LLM,
      voice): ₹0.02 a chat reply and ₹1 a call minute, all-in. Or bring only
      your voice key (scope voice): our speech-to-text, model and telephony, a
      call billed at the voice-only BYOK rate (₹1.50 / $0.02 a minute by
      default), which includes our model — so calls run only on Prana, Prana
      [Voice], GPT-OSS 120B or another model GET /api/v1/models marks
      `voiceOnlyByok` (an agent on any other model runs on Prana on calls) —
      chat replies as usual, on any model. There is no fallback to our providers
      when one of your keys fails. The switch is per workspace, and each agent
      follows it by default: set an agent's `byok` to `"off"` (Create Agent,
      Update Agent) and that one agent runs on our voices and models at our
      normal pricing — chat replies billed normally, the voice-only model limit
      not applied — while your other agents stay on your keys. A call is priced
      and run on one stack: the agent's setting is read once when the call or
      reply starts.
  - name: Webhooks
    description: >-
      Endpoints an agent's events are sent to as they happen — a CRM, a sheet,
      Slack, Zapier, or a helpdesk email address. Each delivery is a signed JSON
      `POST` of `{ "id", "event", "sentAt", "data" }`.


      **Headers on every attempt** (not sent to an email destination, which gets
      one ticket email per event)


      | Header | What it is |

      |---|---|

      | `x-thinnest-signature` | `sha256=<hex HMAC-SHA256 of the raw body>`
      under the endpoint's signing secret. |

      | `x-thinnest-signature-v2` | `sha256=<hex HMAC-SHA256 of
      "<x-thinnest-delivered-at>.<raw body>">` — the delivery time, signed. |

      | `x-thinnest-delivered-at` | When this attempt left (ISO 8601). |

      | `x-thinnest-event-id` | `evt_…`, the same as the body's `id` — stable
      across every retry and re-send. |

      | `x-thinnest-attempt` | `1` for the first attempt, then `2`, `3`, … |


      **Retries.** A delivery that fails — any answer other than 2xx, a timeout
      after 10 seconds, or an address we cannot reach — is tried again after 1
      minute, 5 minutes, 30 minutes, 2 hours and 6 hours (six attempts over
      about 8½ hours). Every attempt sends the **same bytes**, so `sentAt` is
      when the event happened, not when the attempt left. Payloads are kept for
      7 days; within that time any failed delivery can be sent again with
      Redeliver Webhook Events.


      **Dedupe** on `x-thinnest-event-id` (or the body's `id`): a retry after a
      timeout can reach you after you already processed the first attempt.
      Answer 2xx quickly and do the work afterwards.


      **Freshness.** To refuse replayed requests, verify
      `x-thinnest-signature-v2` and reject an `x-thinnest-delivered-at` more
      than five minutes from your clock. Do not check freshness on `sentAt`: a
      retry's `sentAt` is hours old by design.


      **Switch-off.** An endpoint is switched off after five events in a row
      that each failed every attempt — single failed attempts that later succeed
      do not count. Events that happen while it is off are recorded as not sent;
      switch it back on and re-send them.


      The events an endpoint can subscribe to:


      | Event | When it fires |

      |---|---|

      | `lead.captured` | The agent collected a name, email or phone from
      somebody who showed real interest. |

      | `conversation.escalated` | The agent handed a conversation to a person —
      asked for, or because it could not answer. |

      | `conversation.resolved` | A teammate marked a conversation done;
      `data.conversationId` is its `conv_…` id, as Get Conversation takes it. |

      | `call.completed` | A call the agent placed or answered ended — how it
      ended and how long it lasted, sent the moment it ends. |

      | `call.analysed` | A call's results are ready: its summary, the details
      it collected, the transcript, a recording link and what the call cost
      (`costMicro`, `currency`) — the same shape as Get Call. |

      | `campaign.finished` | Every person on a broadcast or a calling campaign
      has been reached, or given up on. |

      | `contact.opted_out` | During a call, somebody asked not to be called
      again; their number (`data.phone`) is now on the do-not-call list;
      `data.source` is `"call"`. |
  - name: Usage
    description: >-
      Read what your workspace used and spent — replies, calls, WhatsApp, the
      balance history and invoices — the same figures as the console's Usage and
      Billing pages. All reads.
  - name: Analytics
    description: >-
      The Dashboard's counts and each agent's Analytics page, for building a
      dashboard of your own that agrees with the console.
  - name: Customers
    description: >-
      Workspaces you create for your own customers when you build a product on
      this API. Each customer has its own agents, contacts, knowledge, phone
      numbers and WhatsApp; your one key reaches any of them by adding
      `Thinnest-Workspace: <customer id>` to a request, and everything they use
      is charged to you. Manage customers from your own workspace, without that
      header.
  - name: Workspace
    description: >-
      Your workspace's own settings — its name and time zone — as Settings →
      General shows them. With `Thinnest-Workspace`, the customer's workspace
      instead.
  - name: Projects
    description: >-
      Projects group a workspace's agents, and are what a team's access is
      scoped by. Every workspace has a default project that cannot be deleted; a
      second project needs a plan with teams and projects.
  - name: Teams
    description: >-
      Teams are groups of members and the projects they can reach. A project
      granted to no team is open to the whole workspace; granting it to a team
      restricts it to that team's members (owners and admins always see
      everything), and removing its last grant opens it up again.
  - name: Members
    description: >-
      The people in your workspace and their roles. An API key acts as an admin,
      never an owner: it can make people admins or members and remove them, but
      cannot make anybody an owner, and the last owner can be neither demoted
      nor removed.
  - name: Invitations
    description: >-
      Invitations to join your workspace, as Settings → Members sends them: an
      email with a link that works for 14 days. Pending invitations count
      towards your plan's seats.
  - name: Notifications
    description: >-
      What each kind of notification does in your workspace: shown in the
      console's feed or muted, and whether it is emailed through the email
      sender you connected in the console.
  - name: Saved replies
