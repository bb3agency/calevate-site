# Calevate — Operations, Quality & Runbooks

Version 1.0

---

## 1. Environments

- **local**: docker-compose (pg+redis+minio), engine mocked via adapter fakes.
- **staging**: DO BLR small; engine (Bolna) staging agents + one test number; synthetic data only.
- **prod**: DO BLR; separate engine workspace/keys; promote-only config flow.

## 2. Engine Verification Session — now executed as the BOLNA PILOT (D-31) [do FIRST]

> D-31 (Aug 2026): ThinnestAI failed due diligence before this session ran; the
> checklist below is executed against Bolna as the pilot scorecard. Adaptations:
> item 1's HMAC criteria become source-IP-allowlist + dedupe + poller verification
> (Bolna webhooks are unsigned, at-most-once — TRD §5); item 5 empirically measures
> webhook loss behavior; item 8 adds: the BYOK platform fee in writing (target
> ≤ ~₹1.5/min), sub-account/agency terms, INR/GST billing, recording
> retention/deletion API, India data-residency terms, Bulbul V3 exposure, Gemini or
> OpenAI-compatible LLM support, Telugu quality of the multilingual KB mode.
> Items failing ⇒ the engine decision reopens (no fallback engine is designated — D-31).

Budget ~₹3–5k (Bolna gives $5 free signup credits + Sarvam's ₹1,000 free credits, so
most of this is real PSTN call spend). 5–7 working days alongside other work.
**H = hard gate (a red H reopens the engine decision); S = soft gate (shapes M1 scope).**

| # | Gate | Pass criteria |
|---|---|---|
| 1 H | Webhook trust | Register a tunnel URL as the agent's `webhook_url`; run calls. Confirm deliveries arrive ONLY from 13.203.39.153 and our allowlist (nginx + in-app) rejects anything else; confirm dedupe on execution_id; confirm the payload matches Get Execution. Docs claim no signing — if a signature header exists, capture it and update TRD §5. |
| 2 H | Full API provisioning | Via API only, no dashboard: create agent → update prompt → attach number → start call (`POST /call`) → `GET /executions/{id}`. Confirm /v2 agent paths, `user_data` context injection round-trips into the prompt, and `scheduled_at` works. |
| 3 H | Telugu quality (BYOK) | Sarvam Saaras V3 STT + Bulbul V3 TTS on OUR keys. 10-utterance Telugu script on real PSTN: names/numbers ≥90% correct; Telugu-English code-mixed handled. Confirm **Bulbul V3 (not v2) is selectable**. |
| 4 H | Real-call latency | 10 PSTN calls: voice-to-voice p50 ≤ 1.1s, p95 ≤ 1.8s (stopwatch + recording analysis). **Vendor latency claims are marketing — their site says "<300ms" undefined; plan only against our own measurement.** Record first-greeting delay after pickup separately (cold-start hides there). |
| 5 H | Telugu turn-taking [NEW, D-32] | Barge-in mid-sentence, and end-of-utterance on slow/hesitant Telugu speech: does the agent cut callers off, or leave dead air? Endpointing is an ORCHESTRATION-layer property — BYOK models do NOT fix it. Measure, never assume. |
| 6 H | Webhook loss behavior | Kill the receiver mid-call: call continues; observe whether ANY retry arrives (docs + OSS code say none). Then confirm the List-Executions poller recovers every missed execution — it is the guarantee of record, so its recovery must be proven, not assumed. |
| 7 S | Post-call data fidelity | `completed` (not `call-disconnected`) carries total_cost + cost_breakdown, recording_url, extracted_data. Verify currency (USD cents), transcript parses into TranscriptTurn, and time-to-`completed` (~2–3 min claimed) against our 2-min lead SLO. |
| 8 S | KB + campaigns + tools + H1 handling [expanded, D-33] | Upload a Telugu FAQ to the rag_id KB (multilingual mode); measure retrieval quality + latency on-call. **Telugu is NOT named in their multilingual mode (Hindi/Tamil are) and the mode is immutable at KB creation** — if Telugu retrieval is poor, the external custom-function route is the fallback (TRD §6.2), so measure both in the same session. Test a custom function to our endpoint and record the tool-call p95 (**no timeout is documented — the ceiling is unmeasured**). Create a 10-contact batch; verify retry policy + per-contact statuses. **KB lifecycle, the two questions D-41's detach contract cannot answer from docs — Bolna publishes no OpenAPI spec, so the row shapes are hand-maintained claims:** (a) does `GET /knowledgebase/all` carry the AGENT LINKAGE we filter on? Our single account holds every tenant's agents, so `list_kb` attributes strictly — a row that does not name the agent is not counted, which means a missing linkage field silently reports every agent as having no knowledge base. (b) does `DELETE /knowledgebase/{rag_id}` also clear the AGENT's reference to it, or does the agent config keep a dangling `rag_id`? If the latter, detach grows a second call (an agent update) — it does NOT become optional. Capture both responses as adapter fixtures. **In-call working memory (H1, TRD §6.1):** does Bolna truncate or summarise conversation history at a window limit, and does it enable provider context caching on BYOK keys? Both drive the LLM leg on long calls. |
| 9 H | Compute region + residency [NEW, D-32] | Where does the call actually execute? (Recordings sit on S3 us-east-1 — storage ≠ compute, but both matter.) Get India data-residency terms + price in writing. This is the one axis where LiveKit beats Bolna on verified evidence today. |
| 10 H | Agency model | Confirm in writing that multiple end-clients under one account is permitted. **Verify the sub-accounts tier discrepancy**: the pricing page lists "Sub-accounts access" under Pilots, the docs call it Enterprise-only. If Pilots includes it, our tenancy model lands far earlier. |
| 11 H | The humans | Open two support threads (one technical, one commercial) during the pilot; record response time and answer quality. **This is the gate ThinnestAI failed** — a good product with unresponsive people is the same trap twice. |
| 12 H | Commercials in writing | **(a) the BYOK platform fee — the single number that decides ₹3–3.6/min; target ≤ ~₹1.5/min**; (b) whether volume tiers apply to BYOK; (c) INR/GST invoicing; (d) price-change notice period (60–90 days); (e) data-export commitment on exit; (f) recording retention + DPDP deletion API; **(g) is the built-in KB (`rag_id`) billed separately, or included in the platform fee? No KB line appears on the pricing page — we have INFERRED "included" and that inference is load-bearing for TRD §6.2 (D-33). Get it in writing, including any per-document/storage/query charge.** Anchors: their published bundled rate is 6.00¢→4.51¢/min; Vapi's comparable orchestration tax is ₹4.40/min (D-32). |
| 13 S | Concurrency ceiling | Pilots advertises 100 concurrent and two customers run 250+ in production (D-32); confirm OUR ceiling, behavior at the limit (queue vs reject + error shape), and the outbound dispatch rate limit (unpublished — measure it; it becomes our dispatcher config, FLOWS §5). Also ask Sarvam (BYOK-tier model concurrency) and Exotel/Vobiz (SIP trunk channels). Effective ceiling = MIN of all three — record all three. |

Parallel ask to Sarvam (not a Bolna gate, but it moves our cost model more than the
platform choice does): **is the Sarvam LLM genuinely free per token** — permanent,
promotional, or rate-limited? If durable it removes the R-04 Gemini-3.x step
(~₹0.55–0.65/min). Also pin Bulbul V3's "beta pricing" (₹30/10k chars) — beta prices move.

Deliverable: filled scorecard committed to `docs/evidence/bolna-pilot-scorecard.md`
(template in repo), with captured payloads saved as adapter fixtures. Passing closes the
D-31 gate and A-1/A-8; a red hard gate reopens the engine decision (no fallback engine
is designated — D-31).

## 3. Per-Client Regression & Eval Harness (the differentiator)

Principle (industry norm): run the suite on EVERY prompt/model/tool/KB change — a small
edit can break a working flow; behavioral coverage (task completed? interruption handled?
no hallucinated tool call?) is what generic uptime monitoring misses.

Structure per client:
- **Scenario suite** (start minimal, grow to 50–100): v1 mandatory five —
  (1) happy path (book/qualify end-to-end), (2) interruption/barge-in mid-sentence,
  (3) tool-call correctness (booking with valid slot), (4) out-of-scope ⇒ T4 refusal +
  follow-up tag, (5) compliance (disclosure spoken; DNC request honored; no cross-sell on
  service agent). Add per-vertical + red-team (injection attempts) as suite grows.
- **Fixtures**: 30+ recorded Telugu/Hindi/mixed utterances incl. hard names, numbers,
  addresses; replayed via engine web-call API or TTS-into-call.
- **Scoring**: transcription accuracy on entities; task success (assert on extraction
  output + tool calls); latency percentiles; LLM-judge rubric for tone/language.
- **Wiring**: suite runs in CI on prompt_versions publish and nightly against live config;
  red result blocks promote; report stored per run (client-shareable PDF = sales asset:
  "we regression-test your agent before every change").

## 4. Observability & Alerting

Dashboards: per-tenant call volume/answer rate/outcomes; latency stage breakdown
(stt/llm_ttft/tts_ttfa/turn p50/p95); post-call pipeline lag; webhook delivery health;
spend vs caps; KB retrieval hit-rates + knowledge-gap list (T4 queries).
LLM tracing (a trace per call, prompt version + token costs attached) is a **named gap,
not a component**: the Langfuse configuration was removed rather than left looking wired
(D-49, TRD §2), so nothing records per-call token cost or the latency breakdown today.

**Alerts, as built (D-49).** The sinks above were "WhatsApp/email to Sri" and for a long
while were neither — `alert()` wrote a structured ERROR log and stopped. It now still
writes that log FIRST and unconditionally (the durable record) and then delivers **by
email**, through the same transport as hot-lead notifications, on a daemon thread off the
request path. No WhatsApp sink: that is a BSP decision (see the open items in ROADMAP §6),
and a second delivery mechanism is a second thing to be broken on the night it is needed.

- **Configuration**: `ALERTS_EMAIL` plus an SMTP host. A non-local service booting with
  neither logs `alert_delivery_unconfigured`, and one with a recipient but no transport
  logs `alert_delivery_has_no_transport` — both at boot, so a deployment where alerts
  reach nobody fails §8's gate visibly rather than silently.
- **Noise bounds**: per-fingerprint repeat suppression keyed on `stage:code`, 15 minutes
  (Alertmanager's `repeat_interval`, tightened because there is one operator and no
  incident console), plus a global token bucket at 20/hour with a burst of 6. Both count
  what they drop and report the count in the next delivered body, so "still broken, 199
  times" never reads as "happened once". A FAILED delivery clears the suppression stamp —
  the window means "a human was told".
- **What it does not touch**: no outbox, no Redis, no database. The alarms that matter
  most are the ones saying those are broken.
- **What triggers one**: webhook failures > 3/5min; pipeline lag > 5 min; latency p95
  breach 15-min sustained; cap approaching (80%)/breached; complaint-spike on campaign;
  engine 5xx spike; nightly job failures; cert/domain expiry.
- **The host backup chain is the exception, and it is not covered by the above.** Backups
  run on the host as `postgres`, outside every Python process, so they cannot call
  `alert()`. `scripts/backup/notify.sh` emits the SAME SHAPE — `failure_stage=HOST_BACKUP`
  with a stable code — to journald and stderr, and forwards it to an optional
  `BACKUP_ALERT_COMMAND` hook that is **not configured** (no endpoint or token belongs in
  the repository). systemd `OnFailure=` covers the failures a script cannot report about
  itself: OOM-killed, killed by a signal, never started. So today a backup failure reaches
  a human only through journald or the hook — **wiring `BACKUP_ALERT_COMMAND` to something
  that reaches the same mailbox is part of applying `infra/backup/`**, and until it is
  done, the alarm that says the database is unrecoverable is the one alarm that does not
  page.

## 5. SLOs (v1)

Lead visible post-hangup ≤ 2 min (99%); webhook ack < 500ms; dashboard p95 < 800ms;
voice p50 ≤ 1.1s; monthly voice-runtime availability 99.5%. Review monthly; tighten with
scale.

## 6. Routine Ops Calendar

Daily: alert triage; pipeline DLQ empty; spend anomalies. Weekly: regression nightly
results review; knowledge-gap report → KB updates; pipeline/latency trend. Monthly:
invoice run; margin per client; rate-card check. Quarterly: restore drill (prove RTO 4h/
RPO 15min) — `runbooks/backup-restore-drill.md`, alternating the R2 PITR chain and the
offsite dump chain, result recorded in `docs/evidence/`; access review; secret rotation;
regulation/pricing re-verify; adapter conformance run against Bolna (keep the exit door
oiled).

## 7. Runbooks (summaries; full steps in /runbooks)

**Written procedures.** Every fact in these is grep-verified against the tree, so where
one differs from a summary below, the runbook is the authority.

- **"Our calls have stopped"** — `runbooks/calls-stopped.md`. The ordered diagnostic for
  the ten conditions behind one symptom: big red switch, load-shed mode, Calevate's own
  TM registration (blocks every tenant at once), the admin spend cap, the client's own
  spend cap, `spend_state.capped` and the trap in clearing it, an empty prepaid wallet,
  the client's PE registration + TM link, subscriber KYC (`self_serve`/`trial` only), and
  the campaign's consent provenance, template, number or a DNC hit. Marks which of these a
  client can self-serve out of. **Not yet covered there and it should be**: the
  first-campaign manual-review hold (D-51), an eleventh cause for `self_serve`/`trial`
  tenants, refusing at launch AND at every dispatch tick as
  `first_campaign_review_pending` / `first_campaign_review_rejected`.
- **Campaign is not dialling** — `runbooks/campaign-stall.md`. The dispatcher's own
  failure modes: tick verdicts, line-pool exhaustion, per-tenant ceiling, contact states,
  the per-dial gate.
- **"You called someone who asked you not to"** — `runbooks/dnc-complaint.md`. DNC
  complaint or TRAI/DLT escalation; the answer is a timeline, not a fix.
- **Campaign follow-up never goes out** — `runbooks/campaign-escalation-refused.md`.
  `escalate_campaign_contact` refusals, split by the line the code itself draws: the ones
  that page a human (`no_provider_configured`, `provider_not_implemented`, template
  failures, ladder exhaustion) and the lawful ones that deliberately do not
  (`recipient_not_opted_in`, `whatsapp_disabled`, every `blocked_*` from the dispatch
  gate). Covers both states of the `messaging` consent purpose.
- **Top-ups and payments** — `runbooks/topup-payments.md`. `payment_capability()` and what
  each refusal means; server-side order creation is NOT implemented
  (`PROVIDER_CREATES_ORDERS = False`) and what to tell a client who wants to pay today;
  the Razorpay signing scheme and payload paths are UNVERIFIED against a live account, so
  the first real payment is an attended test, not a routine.
- **Knowledge base out of sync with the engine** — `runbooks/kb-out-of-sync.md`.
  `kb_engine_ref_unknown` vs `kb_engine_out_of_sync`: same disease, different cures, and
  the wrong cure leaves a client's agent quoting old prices. Includes the manual
  vendor-side withdrawal and its two unverified pilot-gate caveats.
- **Local database cannot reach head** — `runbooks/stale-dev-database.md`. The
  `credit_ledger` CONCURRENTLY unique index that cannot build over permanent pre-cutoff
  duplicates hard rule 4 forbids deleting; a fresh database and `make db-reset`; and why
  `alembic stamp` past it defeats the ancestry gate the index tests depend on.
- **Restoring the production database** — `runbooks/database-restore.md`. Point-in-time
  recovery to a chosen instant (wal-g from R2), single-table recovery from the offsite
  encrypted dump, and the whole-VPS-is-gone path. Includes the six checks that prove a
  restore actually worked rather than merely completed, the `recovery_target_time`
  timezone-abbreviation trap, and the step everyone forgets: **a restore un-erases**, so
  DPDP erasures completed after the recovery target must be replayed from the preserved
  pre-restore cluster before anyone can reach the new one. **Never executed against a real
  cluster** — the mechanism in `infra/backup/` has been applied to nothing.
- **Quarterly restore drill** — `runbooks/backup-restore-drill.md`. The §6 quarterly item,
  made executable and recordable: alternating chains (R2 PITR one quarter, offsite dump the
  next), measured RTO/RPO, a deliberate induced archiving failure to prove the detector
  fires, and a record template committed to `docs/evidence/restore-drill-YYYY-QN.md`.
- **Object-store lifecycle rule** — `runbooks/object-lifecycle.md`. Applying and
  validating the recording-expiry policy, and what it does NOT prove.
- **Events not reaching a client's CRM** — `runbooks/webhook-delivery-failures.md`. Outbox
  → ARQ → delivery forensics, plus the client-side checks to hand them.

**Summaries only** (no written runbook yet):

- **Engine outage**: numbers fail over to client phones (provisioned fallback); status
  banner in dashboards; reconcile calls post-recovery; if >4h, activate Bolna adapter for
  new calls (numbers re-point), inform clients.
- **Webhook signature failures**: treat as attack until proven config drift; block source,
  rotate secret, audit deliveries.
- **Data breach (suspected)**: contain (revoke keys, rotate, big red switch if needed) →
  scope via audit_log/webhook_deliveries → classify under DPDP → notify Board + affected
  principals per Rules timeline → postmortem in repo.
- **Runaway campaign**: auto-pause on cap/complaint alarm; verify DNC + template status;
  client comms template ready.
- **Deletion request**: FLOWS §9 procedure; 7-day internal SLA; proof certificate issued.
- **Model retirement (e.g., Gemini 2.5 on 16 Oct 2026)**: switch config on staging →
  full regression suite → promote per client → note in decision log.
